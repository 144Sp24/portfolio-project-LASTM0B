            <p>Hello My name is Dorian Jenkins. I was born in Landstuhl a small town in Germany and have been all over the US due to my dads millitary status. My Mom is from Germany and My dad is from the US allowing me to be exposed to a lot of diffrent cultures and ideas.</p> <p>I love almost anything to due with computers. When I was younger my mom would worked for a computer company and was always playing games on her computer. Watching her work and play games sparked my interest and is why I am making this website today</p>
            <p>I currently go to Northwest Missouri State University as a Freshman with a major in computer sciences, but I will soon change schools to prusue my actual dream of Game desgin.</p>
            <p>Also if you couldn't tell my favorite color may or may not be Blue!</p>
            <p>I started making websites for school but this is also one of my hobbies.
